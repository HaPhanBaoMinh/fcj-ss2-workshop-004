# Predicting Temperature & Humidity from ESP32 Data via IoT Core

![Overview](/fcj-ss2-workshop-003/images/00.png)

## 1. Overview

In this article, we will explore how to use the ESP32 to measure temperature and humidity from a temperature and humidity sensor, then send the data to AWS IoT CORE and store it in DynamoDB. We will then use Lambda to normalize the data. Finally, we will use AWS SageMaker Canvas to make predictions about future temperature and humidity.

This lab can be applied in various fields such as agriculture, healthcare, industry, etc.

## 2. Objectives
- Understand how to use the ESP32 to measure temperature and humidity from a temperature and humidity sensor.
- Understand how to send data to AWS IoT CORE and store it in DynamoDB.
- Understand how to use Lambda to normalize the data.
- Understand how to use AWS SageMaker Canvas to make predictions about future temperature and humidity.
